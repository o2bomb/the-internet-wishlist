## Things I learned from this project
- In order for a `<a>` element to be able to be focused on (tabbable) it needs to have the `href` attribute set
- A debounce function that is used within a functional component in React will only work if it is wrapped in `React.useCallback()` (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55616626))
